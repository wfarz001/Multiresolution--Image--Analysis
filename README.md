# Multiresolution--Image--Analysis
The goal of this project is to implement Haar Transform (HT) for multiresolution (MR) image analysis.
Task. 1. First, implement HT following the discussion in text on page 490 â€“ 493 for N= 8. Reproduce Figure 6.18 from text. (Book-Digital Image Processing)
Task.2 Next, apply this HT transform on the Tree image to obtain forward Haar transformed image and display the transformed image.
Task.3. Obtain inverse transformed image and display the image.
Task.4. Compare your original and transformed images and clearly discuss your findings.
Task 5: Discuss how HT follows the properties of a basic wavelet transform.
